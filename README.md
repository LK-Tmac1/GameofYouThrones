##Story
I used to play video games a lot, but now prefer watching other people playing games on YouTube since I become busier and, lazier... Sometimes I get subscription emails from the channels I subscribed. I am jealous about those channel owners since it seems that they can make money from not only ads, but also subscribers, by playing video games: http://bit.ly/1M8xzcD, http://bit.ly/1KWZYA4.

So I was curious if there was a way that could help channel owners to know the popularity of their videos and channels on YouTube.
