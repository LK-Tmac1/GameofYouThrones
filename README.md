# GameofYouThrones

##Story
I used to play video games a lot, but now prefer watching other people playing games on YouTube since I become busier and lazier...
Sometimes I get subscription emails from the channels I subscribed, and it seems those channel owners since it seems that they can make money from not only ads, but also subscribers: http://bit.ly/1M8xzcD, http://bit.ly/1KWZYA4.
So I was curious if there was a way that could help channel owners to know the popularity of their videos and channels on YouTube, as there are 8000~ channels, 400~ millions videos, and 1~ billion users. You can imagine how many user activities are there each day.
