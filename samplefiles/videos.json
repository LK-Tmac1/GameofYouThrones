This time, they end up in Washington, DC but, things seem to be a bit out of place!  SkyDoesMinecraft notices that ivy, vines and overgrowth is everywhere.  RagingHouse notices that lawns are pocked marked with small brush fires!  JinBopGaming spots people over by the Washington Monument and asks what’s going on with them!  When the person hears JinBopGaming, he looks up and begins walking towards JinBopGaming and SkyDoesMinecraft!  The person is actually a zombie!  Before anyone realizes what’s going on, RagingHouse opens fire on the zombie and disables it!  But soon, SkyDoesMinecraft, JinBopGaming, ThatGuyBarney and RagingHouse grow weary of their zombie killing spree and go back to JinBopGaming’s inter-dimensional time travel adventure machine!  SkyDoesMinecraft, JinBopGaming, ThatGuyBarney and RagingHouse end up in a lush tropical environment which is actually a pirate’s cove!  JinBopGaming stumbles across a room filled with all kinds of valuable stuff and, of course plenty of barrels!  The only thing that’s really out of place in this room is a dead body!  JinBopGaming is now convinced that they are all on a pirate island dimension!   The more SkyDoesMinecraft, JinBopGaming, ThatGuyBarney and RagingHouse explore the pirate island, the more awesome it seems to be!  After their brief adventure, SkyDoesMinecraft, JinBopGaming, ThatGuyBarney and RagingHouse go back to JinBopGaming’s machine and travel to another dimension!  But, this time, SkyDoesMinecraft, JinBopGaming, ThatGuyBarney and RagingHouse end up outside of the machine!  JinBopGaming, locked behind what appears to be a jail cell, points out to SkyDoesMinecraft that the timelines are ruptured due to their constant use of the machine!  And things get a bit crazy in this new dimension. Things are beginning to look a little familiar to SkyDoesMinecraft!  SkyDoesMinecraft, ThatGuyBarney and RagingHouse find a kitchen and grab some food in this place that looks like a prison!  SkyDoesMinecraft also manages to find a key that will unlock JinBopGaming from his cell!  Growing very weary of this prison-like dimension  SkyDoesMinecraft, ThatGuyBarney and RagingHouse decide to leave, go back to the machine and travel to a different dimension!  JinBopGaming is convinced that if they leave now, the fabric of time will continue to distort and rupture even more than before!  Will SkyDoesMinecraft, ThatGuyBarney and RagingHouse pay attention to what JinBopGaming has to say?  Or, will they leave anyway, putting their lives at risk and, for that matter, risk the whole universe as we know it?  Find out in this Minecraft Roommates Roleplay 10 video!
